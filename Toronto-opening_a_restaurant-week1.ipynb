    "One of the most important factors determining a success in opening and running a restaurant business is the location. The most suitable location can be characterised by the following criteria: \n",
    "- sizable population\n",
    "- positive population growth in the last years\n",
    "- higher income\n",
    "- low number of restaurants in the vicinity (restaurants per person). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, other regional characteristics, such as the biggest minority population (other cultures) can also affect the suitability for a restaurant with a particular cuisine. \n",
    "Therefore, the question to be solved is to **identify neighborhoods with the lowest ratio of restaurants per population, ideally with high income and still growing population** (e.g. newly developing areas). \n"
